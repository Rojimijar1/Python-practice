#In a file called fuel.py, implement a program that prompts the user 
# for a fraction, formatted as X/Y, wherein X is a non-negative 
# integer and Y is a positive integer, and then outputs, as a 
# percentage rounded to the nearest integer, how much fuel is in the 
# tank. If, though, 1% or less remains, output E instead to indicate
#  that the tank is essentially empty. And if 99% or more remains, 
# output F instead to indicate that the tank is essentially full.

#If, though, X or Y is not an integer, X is greater than Y, or Y is 0, instead prompt the user again. (It is not necessary for Y to be 4.) Be sure to catch any exceptions like ValueError or ZeroDivisionError.
